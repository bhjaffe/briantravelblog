</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I (heart) Sydney.Â  I had already been in the city for two days when I first saw this T-shirt on a fellow tourist while wandering the scenic, sloping pathways of Toronga Zoo on the north side of Sydney Harbor.Â  It was a beautiful sunny day, and spending the prime hours of it looking at koalas, kangaroos, and an impressive collection of poisonous snakes in my first visit to a zoo since high school felt all too fitting for a stay in Sydney that was already engendering feelings of infatuation I thought had gone the way of adolescence within me.Â  By day three Sydney had me in the palm of its hand, and after seeing that T-shirt, I kept repeating it both in my head and out loud to anyone who would listen for the remainder of my five-day visit there.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Part of this must have been because of where I had just come form.Â  Landing in Sydney on a Friday night, I was instantly overwhelmed by a feeling of normalcy and ease after spending the previous two months motorcycling through India.Â  Things just made sense again: customs, baggage claim, the local commuter train, the presence of crosswalks and traffic lights, and the lack of honking and choking traffic.Â  Sydney was doing well in my mind even before I stepped foot into the hostel where my American friend Lane was meeting me, but I hadnât seen anything yet.Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For starters, the hostel we were staying at was unlike any lodging by a similar label I had ever experienced before.Â  While Lane and IÂ <em style="">were</em>Â sharing a modest sized room with six other people, the facilities were nicer than those in most of the hotels Iâd stayed at during my previous travels in India and South America.Â  The beds were comfortable, the floors had new carpeting, the walls were freshly painted, and most importantly: the bathrooms were large, clean, and supplied with inexhaustible high-pressure hot water (a true novelty after my recent travels).Â  Downstairs there was a spacious lobby with computers and phones, a cafÃ© that served tasty meals and sandwiches, a street-corner patio to enjoy some early evening drinks, and even a nightclub (albeit, dominated by the twenty-one and under crowd) in the basement! Â When I described it the next day to an Australian friend with whom I had traveled in South America I said, âThis place has died and gone to Hostel Heaven.â</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After checking in, dropping off my luggage on a bottom bunk bed of my new room and heading back downstairs, I was immediately introduced to two Dutch girls and an American guy Lane had just befriended while sipping wine on the corner patio, waiting for me to arrive.Â  Two of them werenât even staying at the hostel, but had just come to its bar to hang out, and before long the five of us were off to grab a late dinner at a nearby pub where we enjoyed the cool evening air and good company until nearly midnight.Â  Before we parted ways the one Dutch girl who actually lives in Sydney invited us all to a barbeque/house party she and her Czech friend were throwing the following evening in a nearby neighborhood.Â  At this point I had been on the ground less than four hours and I had already been invited to what would become an evening of more good olâ fashion fun than I had had since leaving Cuenca, Ecuador over three months before.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Over the next couple days Lane and I walked all over the city: down clean gridded streets, past modern shopping complexes, through mature gardens and parks, and along the ever-curving shoreline of Sydneyâs multi-fingered harbor and scenic beaches.Â  The landscape was so eerily serene and its citizens so shockingly polite and helpful, I could hardly believe I was at the heart of a metropolis more than half the size of New York City.Â  Friendly service, a diverse selection of food, and the taste of beer not named Kingfisher topped off the easing of my mindset from adventure traveler to indulgent vacationer, and the transition could not have felt better.Â Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Sydney impressed me more than simply showing me a good time, though.Â  Beyond its beautiful skyline, beautiful natural scenery, and equally beautiful people, Sydney also showed me a lifestyle that, in sharp contrast to that of places I had thus far traveled along my world tour, appeared not only to be so much in line with that which I would hope to soon enjoy after I complete my travels, but also remarkably achievable for both Australians and the myriad European and North American expatriates who also call Sydney home.Â  I met Dutch, Czechs, Canadians, Germans, Irish, French, Greeks and New Zealanders who all appeared to move as full members of this city that sits contently at the edge of the world.Â  And it was through their eyes, or at least what I imagined their perspectives to be, that another thought crept silently into my mind, one wholly unexpected when I arrived just a few days before: Sydney could be my home too.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Not just in the past few months, but over all of my twenty-eight years I have had the great fortune to visit and experience, either for a couple days or for a year or longer, hundreds of different cities and towns that are not my home.Â  Iâve lived abroad twice, traveled abroad countless times, and come to know many cities that inspire people to move great distances to be apart of.Â  Yet for all the Parisâs, Romes, Londons, and New York Cities I have encountered, I could not remember one stinging me quite the way Sydney had in my brief stay there, and I could not shake this thought during the dayâs train ride away from Sydney as Lane and I continued our Australian tour toward Melbourne.Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Melbourne is Australiaâs second largest city and a place some even claim to enjoy more than Sydney. Â In my mind, however, it was doomed upon my arrival to play second fiddle to her flashy older sister, so I was not surprised when I quickly determined that while also clean, friendly, nicely laid out, and possessing an even better public transportation system than Sydneyâs, Melbourne could never come close to wowing me to the same degree I had just been.Â  In keeping with this assessment, and also realizing there are no must-see tourists stops like Sydneyâs Opera House or Bondi Beach, Lane and I took the next two days to simply wander Melbourneâs various neighborhoods, enjoy good food, do a bit of shopping, and catch up on those often overlooked travel necessities like laundry and corresponding with people from back home.Â  Yet while doing all this, once again Lane and I both found ourselves strangely under the spell of how nice of a place Melbourne was.Â  âIs this just because I came here straight from India?â I remember asking him.Â  âNo,â he said confidently, âI just came fromÂ <em style="">Hawaii</em>Â and I think this place is amazing.â</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">On our last two evenings in Melbourne we had the great fortune to go out with locals, the first being a recent friend of mine from my travels in South America, and the second being an old friend of Laneâs with whom he taught English in Istanbul.Â  On the first night we met my friend for dumplings in Melbourneâs quaint China Town and then went to a preseason match of Australian Rules Football, or âFootyâ as the locals call it.Â  Lane and I quickly ingratiated ourselves to surrounding fans (though to the unfortunate embarrassment of our hostess) with our boisterous and enthusiastic support of the home team, all the while only vaguely understanding the rules and strategy of the game.Â  It was a truly Melbournean experience that I am certain to remember fondly whenever I see the rare Australian Rules Football highlight on SportsCenter back home.Â  The following night, however, turned out to be even more enjoyable, and in true Melbourne fashion this was despite its comparative ease and simplicity.Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We met Laneâs friend Lou at a funky little cafÃ©/bar in what she immediately described to us as not only her home neighborhood, but also the cityâs hipster district, and after some general introductions and catching up she proposed a delightful little plan for the evening: a pub crawl to some of her favorite local spots.Â  Over the next seven hours we went to an equal number of truly unique pubs and bars, any one of which would have been my favorite place to go out in the last city I lived in.Â  There was a brightly lit, high aluminum ceilinged micro-brew warehouse that conjured images of a modern German beer hall filled with large wooden picnic-style tables and benches and surrounded by a few high tables with stools.Â  From there we went to a haggard saloon that could have been straight out of the American Southwest.Â  Playing there, just feet before a cliental averaging at least forty-years-old, was a blues band of the same dimensions: weathered, talented, and with a leather-clad vocalist sporting red lipstick brighter than Iâve ever seen, at least on someone her age.Â  She ended the set with a soulful rendition of âFly me an angel down from Montgomeryâ that would have made my night all by itself.Â  From there we went to an outdoor eatery with its kitchen in an Airstream trailer, a practically unmarked local wood paneled pub, an old distillery-turned-tapas restaurant, and a speakeasy styled bar accessed only by walking up a narrow unmarked stairwell at the back of a different speakeasy styled bar.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Not only was the eclectic variety of venues thoroughly enjoyable, so was the ease of conversation with everyone I met, especially Lou.Â  As she described her life in Melbourne to me â her job, her friends, her plans for her upcoming wedding (sheâs hoping to hold it at the Airstream eatery), it once again became apparent that Melbourne is another city in which I too could build a happy life.Â  She even drove the point home: if I really am as un-tied down as I say I am, why not consider Melbourne as a real option?Â  So many other foreigners, especially English speaking ones, come to Australia; why couldnât I?Â  I told her Iâd think on it, but even before the cab ride back to my hotel and my conversation on the same topic with Lane, I began to recognize the real desire within me, and it had less to do with any individual place than I had first recognized.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The more I think about it the more I am certain that what I want is not to live in Sydney or Melbourne at all.Â  What I really want is theÂ <em style="">life</em>Â I witnessed in both cities and a connection to a place I wonât soon be leaving.Â  I want to love the neighborhood I walk around on a Saturday afternoon.Â  I want to love the bar I go to on a Friday night.Â  I want to love the friends I meet just because we live down the street from each other, and I want to love the local sports, culture and festivals that make my city unique.Â  I also want to feel like I am a part of a community that looks at the world and our role within it in a similar way to how I do.Â  This is what I saw in both Sydney and Melbourne.Â  And unlike seeing another man with a beautiful and fun girlfriend or wife and thinking jealously, âHow nice would it be to have her in my life,â with a city I actuallyÂ <em style="">could</em>Â have the exact same city as another without depriving anyone else of anything.Â  So yes, I was taken in by the charms of these two admittedly wonderful cities, and knowing that they are here, knowing that should I strike out at finding a similar life back in America they will be here with arms open, is great to know and a great option to have, even if I intend never to exercise it.
