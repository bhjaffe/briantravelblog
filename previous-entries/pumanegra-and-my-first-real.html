</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">



















</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">



















</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I'm on the road at the edge of Cuenca, searching for a landmark to show me where I am. Â PumaNegra, my so-named 200 cc motorcycle, rumbles beneath me better than she has ever sounded before. Â This is my fourth outing, but today I am determined to do what I failed to accomplish any time before, which is get out of Cuenca entirely and explore the countryside beyond.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">My ownership of PumaNegra, although only a week old, has already had its ups and downs. Â From constant stalling when I first bought her to the crippling one-two combo of a flat tire plus a blocked fuel line last time I took her out (clogging a busy intersection, rolling her to the nearest mechanic), our relationship hasn't been the smoothest. Â But today I am feeling confident - and adventurous. Â I bought a motorcycle to explore the verdant mountainscape I saw from the airplane when I flew into Cuenca two weeks ago, and I'll be damned if a few hiccups will leave me too scared to leave the city limits and the lifelines therein. Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 14px; " class="Apple-style-span">I finally spot the hospital I've been looking for and make a sharp right turn. Â As I come over a rise I see my goal in front of me, an almost forgotten looking two-lane road leading straight into a gap in the ring of hills surrounding the city. Â As I cross the last intersection and roll on the throttle a tinge of excitement runs through my body. Â I feel like I'm escaping from something and where I'm going next is completely unknown.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Almost instantly, both my surroundings and my mood change. Â With two rolling curves through the tree filled gap, I am officially out of Cuenca and into the countryside! Â The road is smooth with very few other vehicles on it, and I instantly feel relief from being free of city traffic. Â Old and new houses line the road and the farther I go the more distance there is between each structure. Â The ground is dark green and brown and the smell of turned soil and farm animals fills the air. Â Men and women walk the roadsides, and I pass the occasional public bus. Â I am happy knowing that at least I won't be completely stranded if something goes wrong here. Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As I wind along the curvy road and rise farther into the hill country the landscape changes subtly again. Â The farmhouses become less frequent and between the fields there are now patches of forest and untilled land. Â I enter a small town, maybe better described as a village, with a central square and a prominent church towering above all other structure at more than twice their height. Â This is where I make my first navigational decision. Â The paved road goes left, but it appears to be heading downhill. Â I want to keep going up, and to the right of the church a gravel road curls behind the village. Â It is big enough to be a road that might actually go somewhere, so I decide to take it. Â My feeling is instantly confirmed I see coming toward me a blue public bus lumbering over ruts and billowing a cloud of dust behind it. Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This road is definitely new territory for PumaNegra and me, and I am grateful for her high clearance and traction tires. Â As I continue up the rut-filled road at a conservative twenty-five kilometers per hour on my speedometer, the surroundings become even more rural and the few people I pass look even more surprised to see me there. Â Two children point and laugh excitedly as I drive by and two dark skinned women, one with a child on her back and another with long black hair below her waist slowly move out of the center of the road as I approach them from behind. Â If I ever wondered whether I'd see the real Ecuador, I think I have found it. Â I want to stop and take a picture of the impressive views off to my left, but I worry that to linger for any amount of time longer than it takes to drive by would forfeit the locals' forgiveness for my having disrupted their usual serenity.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I finally reach the highest point of the road. Â Towering above me to my right is a jagged mountain with two peaks that look like giant triangular shark teeth coming upward out of the ridge. Â It's not the mountain's height that is impressive, but how quickly and how closely I have approached it. Â By contrast, to my left an entire valley stretching over lower hills almost all the way to the horizon. Â Ominous looking clouds lurk overhead. Â They're probably at 20,000 feet, but from this elevation the clouds look close too. Â </span></p>

			<div class="first graphic-container wide center ImageElement"><!-- sandvox.ImageElement --><img width="430" height="286" src="../public_html/_Media/mountain_with_clouds_med.jpeg" alt="Mountain with clouds" class="graphic graphic" /><!-- /sandvox.ImageElement --></div><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As I descend I am now determined to find a place to stop and take a picture. Â I pass through a grouping of houses and make a sharp turn away from the mountain. Â A quick rise follows and then before me I see a flat patch of undeveloped land, so I stop my bike and get out to enjoy the view.</span></p>

			<div class="not-first-item graphic-container wide center ImageElement"><!-- sandvox.ImageElement --><img width="430" height="179" src="../public_html/_Media/panorama_view_med.jpeg" alt="Panorama view" class="graphic graphic" /><!-- /sandvox.ImageElement --></div>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Taking my helmet and gloves off I walk along the little knoll sticking out into the valley's center. Â The view is extraordinary! Â I'm pretty sure I see Cuenca far off to the left, but I can't make out the distinctive blue domes of the Cathedral, so maybe I'm just seeing the suburbs. Â To the right I see the highway running alongside the river at the bottom of the valley, and the giant hilltop statue (I think of Jesus, though I'm not sure) that towered above a town my bus drove through last weekend looks tiny and low in the distance. Â This would be such a great place for a picnic. Â I'll remember this spot if I ever have someone crazy enough to want to ride with me. Â I snap a few pictures then remount my bike for the descent.</span></p>

			<div class="not-first-item graphic-container wide center ImageElement"><!-- sandvox.ImageElement --><img width="430" height="296" src="../public_html/_Media/me_with_valley_behind_med.jpeg" alt="Me with valley behind" class="graphic graphic" /><!-- /sandvox.ImageElement --></div>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Almost immediately I remember why I enjoy going uphill so much more than going downhill. Â Breaking becomes much more difficult, and I move slowly as each steep section seems to be directly followed by a ninety degree turn. Â I come to another village, this one even smaller than the first, and as if to greet me in the middle of the road stand twoÂ </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 14px; " class="Apple-style-span">cows with "we don't let just anyone past" expressions and mean looking horns to go with them. Â A</span><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">nd I'm closing fast! Â Thankfully, they're tethered such that they can't reach the far left side of the road, and without waiting to see just how much interest they want to take in me, I scoot around them to safety. Â Happily past the bulls, the village's second welcome committee catches me off guard: a very large barking dog. Â He is definitely not tethered and is running straight at me! Â I accelerate aggressively, and luckily for him and me we miss each other by a couple feet.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">All of this animal avoidance has made me unaware that is has started to sprinkle. Â And by sprinkle, the now constant pings on my helmet's face shield remind me, I do mean rain. Â It's funny, because being so protected from the elements by my helmet, jacket and gloves, it almost takes looking down at my now wet pants to confirm this fact. Â The deceptive thing is that the valley directly in front of me is still entirely soaked in sunlight, so perhaps I can just outrun this raincloud.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The puddle filled dirt road finally changed back to asphalt and straightens out considerably. Â With this improvement in traction and line of sight, I zoom downhill at my fastest pace yet. Â I leave the rain and almost instantly I am dry again. Â I am reentering modernity. Â Dump trucks pass me going up the hill and new looking building begin to dot the roadside. Â Finally, as if to confirm that my overland trek has ended as quickly as it began, in front of me are the highway underpass and my ticket back to Cuenca. Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The ride back on the highway is easy and uneventful. Â My only real anxiety comes from flashbacks of the last time I traveled such a road on a two-wheeled vehicle, but that was at night in Tuscany, Italy on a 100 cc scooter with an equally terrified girlfriend clinging to me from the nub of a backseat she was sitting on - in other words, that was completely different.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After exiting the highway an off-ramp early and then making a couple requisite wrong turns, I triumphantly arrive back at my host family's home. What an amazing ride, and to think how easy it was too! Â As the sun goes down I look at the mountains surrounding the city just a little differently now. Â Your secrets aren't as safe as they once were. Â I'm coming to see them, just give me a few days. Â </span></p>
