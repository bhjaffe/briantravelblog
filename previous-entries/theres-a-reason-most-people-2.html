<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I wouldnât always have been able to stomach my present situation so calmly.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Indeed, even three days ago the vulnerability and exposure of my present predicament, being, despite my best effort at conspicuousness, the clear favorite for beggars, onlookers, and even stray dogs, would have severely unnerved me, but a lot has happened in the last seventy-two hours to change my perspective, and even though it has been a trial of extreme frustration and many defeats, I think I am finally beginning to turn a corner on what it means to be traveling in the real India and what sort of attitude is required to succeed as a traveler here.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The reason I say the real India is because not everyone would choose to travel the way I am traveling.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Indeed, most westerners would never have even attempted it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, many months ago my best friend Nick and I decided, albeit with a heavy dose of naÃ¯ve ignorance, that the capstone of our pre-graduate school travel would be to tour India on Royal Enfield motorcycles, and now, all those months later, here we are about to take a one-way train ride hundreds of miles from our nearest contact into the very heart of India with nothing more than a couple bags, two rented motorcycles, and Nickâs friend Sally as a companion for our first ten days of traveling.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As desired, adventure is surely before us, but even getting to this point already seems like a small miracle when looking back on it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Three days ago I was in the city of Patiala in the northern Indian state of Punjab attending a wedding reception for my sister and her newly wedded Indian husband.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The reception was at an old palace that is now a hotel, and needless to say every available form of comfort and ease was being afforded to us.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Delicious breakfasts met us in the mornings, drivers chauffeured us around town as necessary, and a seemingly endless supply of tea and drinks were constantly being offered to us.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Life was good and life was simple, that is, until we set out for our return journey to Delhi the following day.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Our trip from Delhi to Patiala had been our maiden motorcycle voyage in India, and the experience proved much more difficult than expected; however, with tips from my brother-in-lawâs family and lessons learned from our first outing, we were confident that the return trip to Delhi would go much easier.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This was true so much as that the transit from Patiala to the outskirts of Delhi that had been so trying in the opposite direction two days before flew by with relative ease.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, once we reached Delhi the indisputable complication of navigating a completely foreign metropolis took over, and our apparent good fortune made a distinct turn for the worse.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We arrived in Delhi around three thirty in the afternoon and our first task was to swing by the motorcycle shop from where weâd rented the bikes to switch out the silver motorcycle Iâd been riding for a red, slightly nicer one weâd arranged to rent a month prior but that had been unexpected unavailable the week before.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Swapping one motorcycle for another: how long should this take?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The answer: two and a half hours minimum.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">To his credit, the owner of the motorcycle shop, Lalli Singh, is an invaluably honest and reliable businessman without whom I am certain this entire expedition would not be possible.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, speed is not his forte, and as the sun set somewhere outside his basement shop floor we were still sitting in small wooden chairs in front of his desk wondering what was possibly taking so long.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Finally completing the swap we rode to our next errand destination, the hotel I had been staying at prior to my trip to Patiala.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">My purpose there was to retrieve items Iâd left behind in my room safe, and once again, all expectations were that this would be a very quick in-and-out affair.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Wrong again.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For some reason this quick retrieval took over forty minutes as one reception attendant after another assured me that my stuff was âon the wayâ as I waited dumbly in the lobby for something to actually happen.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">On a normal day this would have been only a minor inconvenience, but to Nick, Sally and I, who had been on the road since ten in the morning and had not eaten a proper meal since nine, hunger, frustration and anxiety were building steadily, and our final task of the evening: finding the hotel weâd booked in central Delhi, still stood before us.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">To add to it all a drizzle that had been threatening all day was starting to turn to a steady rain.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This is when things really got bad.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We made our way back in to the crowded narrow streets of one of the bazar districts in central Delhi where Google Maps showed our hotel being located.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">At this point we knew better than to expect street signs, but weâd planned ahead and drawn some detailed maps, so we at least had confidence that we could get within asking distance of the hotelâs location.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This turned to be a total nightmare.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">First off, Nick and I, frustrated and tired, had different ideas of how to get there, and we also both thought the other was understanding of who would be leading the way.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This led us to get temporarily separated in the midst of the choking Delhi traffic, and when we met up we both had heated tempers and harsh words for whose fault it was we had almost lost each other.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">A few minutes later we entered the bazar and our entire definition of dense traffic was redefined as the mixture of people, rickshaws, horse drawn carriages, and motorcycles trying to squeeze down incredibly narrow streets made going faster than a crawl absolutely impossible.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Sure enough, one stall too many coupled with being stuck behind the worldâs slowest ox cart separated me from Nick and Sally, and given that the sheer density of street traffic kept line of sight to something around twenty-five feet, no sooner had I looked up than I realized their black motorcycle was nowhere in sight.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I tried frantically to make up ground through the gridlock of men and beasts, but it was to no avail.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I asked for directions from anyone who looked like they might know English, but they all told me I was miles away from the hotel.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">What about Nick and Sally?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Had this really become every man for himself?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Just as my panic began to mount I heard my name being shouted from over my shoulder.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It was Nick.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">He and Sally had emerged from somewhere, equally unsuccessful in finding the hotel.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After one more dead end we decided to backtrack at the insistence of a rickshaw driver, and before we knew it we were out of the bazar altogether crossing over the railroad yard into a completely different neighborhood.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">At least this one looked promising, because every other building had bright neon lights with hotel names reflecting off the now wet roadway.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But where was ours?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We stopped and asked for more directions, and more directions, and people tried to take us to their own hotels instead until said we insisted we already had reservations. Â Then I dropped my bike on the now incredibly slick street surface, screaming ahead to Nick as I went down so that he wouldnât leave me behind again.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We went down smaller and shadier looking streets, passing by literally dozens of hotels, but none of them were ours, and once again, for the second time in three days, we were all at our wits end unable to finish another exhausting day of motorcycling.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Finally, out of the corner of my eye I caught a sign with the word Metropolis (our hotelâs name) on it, and we regained a glimmer of hope.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It turned out our actual hotel was still a block and a half away, but within ten minutes we were there and off the bikes we once again swore weâd never get back on no matter what the circumstances or how much someone were to pay us.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After checking into our rooms we ate dinner and had a few beers at a nearby restaurant, but even though we thought our moods had improved, below the surface Nick and I were still both extremely frazzled and agitated by the dayâs events.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This below-the-surface anger finally showed its ugly head just before we went to bed when he and I got into it with each other over the stupidest thing in a way that in all the years weâve known each other has never once even come close to happening.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I went to bed furious and frustrated, angry and alone, and wondering why I had ever decided to undertake this trip that so many people had told me was a crazy idea all the previous months Iâd been flaunting it as such a great adventure.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The next day I woke up still angry, but after eating breakfast by myself I knocked on Nick and Sallyâs room door, and as a testament to why Nick and I are such good friends, we sat down in my room (Sally was still asleep) and asked out loud, "What the hell is going on?"</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The truth is, Nick and I, who to our friends and co-workers have both always been known as cool under pressure and level headed in the face of adversity, were both already being pushed to our limits by our motorcycle trip in India, and we had only just completed our self-titled shakedown ride.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">How were we ever going to survive nearly two more months on the road?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Our biggest conclusion was that, like it or not, we had to reset our expectations and accept that lessons have to be learned, often the hard way, and that thatâs part of what makes an adventure an adventure in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After all, we finally laughed, thereâs a reason most people donât do this.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Over the next two days, from that conversation until right now, I have made efforts to both enjoy India for a change and to take precautions to avoid a repeat of what weâd just been through on our way to and from Patiala.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  First IÂ </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">spent some time doing what most people center their entire Indian vacations around: seeing some of the truly amazing monuments around the city.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I also spent half a day tracking down and purchasing a GPS unit (which, even given the amount of time I invested in the project, still seemed like a total coup to have so expeditiously procured given the pace at which any transaction is accomplished here in India).</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Finally, I called a guesthouse in Varanasi that had been highly recommended to me and arranged to have a driver waiting for us at the train station so we wonât have to try to navigate the horde of extortion artists and otherwise semi-informed, semi-English speaking passers by who await western tourists at every major sightseeing destination after arriving on the overnight train.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  Â </span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">A few hours ago a man from Lalli Singhâs motorcycle shop came and met us at our hotel and escorted us to the freight terminal from where the bikes are now being loaded onto the train.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Nick left half an hour ago to meet Sally, who was doing some last minute shopping around town, and so Iâm here watching over our bags until they come back.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As I look over the ever moving mass of people all about me in this most unique of settings I do have a sense of pride that Iâve made it this far, that Iâve been able to succeed at some tasks over the last two days, and that despite the early trials of this journey Iâm still eager to forge ahead with what comes next.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Although the word risks being overused, true adventure isnât easy by definition, and Iâve come to appreciate this truth more in the last few days than in all of my travels yet to date.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Iâm sure more hard time will come mixed with the good, more frustration will come mixed with the joy, and more anxiety will come mixed with the elation, but as long as that second half keeps coming I must insist sitting here, taking it all in, that this experience is still worth all the anguish and then some.</span></p>
