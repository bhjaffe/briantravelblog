</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The process of modernization is on grand display in many corners of the world, but in my experience no example rivals the side-by-side coexistence of new and old that I have witnessed during my last weekâs journey through central China.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In many countries there are very modern parts, usually in wealthy city centers or elite suburbs, and then regions where apart from a few hints of modernity (such as cell phones), infrastructure and ways of life look decades behind in terms of development.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">China, however, is different.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Perhaps it is a legacy of sixty years of Communist rule or due to the suddenness in which China found itself with an excess of wealth, both public and private, but whatever the cause, in this country the new and the old, the modern and the traditional stand side by side, literally in the same picture frame, especially outside the major business and political centers of Shanghai and Beijing.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">My first prospective of central China was Xiâan.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This ancient Chinese capital, home to the first emperor starting point of the Silk Road, is also a vibrant modern city of eight million people that simultaneously celebrates its storied past and seeks to be a model for future urban planning.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The old city is still surrounded by a six-hundred-year-old wall and moat, which are incredibly more than twice the size of any other city fortification I have ever seen.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Equally impressive is the fact that instead of either demolishing this wall and filling in the moat or restricting access to them as part of a museum, the city has turned the space into a park â the wall serving as a scenic elevated bike and walking path and the land between the wall and the moat transformed into a beautiful ribbon of landscaped gardens.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The juxtaposition of ancient architecture and modern metropolis continues at the city center, where the old imperial bell and drum towers overlook the cityâs largest traffic circle and central square.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Similarly, not far outside the ancient wall, a large park and vibrant shopping district surround a thirteen hundred-year-old pagoda, the oldest building in the region, and descending in front of it a long slope of terraced pools features programmable fountains that dance every thirty minutes to traditional Chinese music.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">While impressive and in my opinion a great use of old buildings, modern cities celebrating ancient monuments within their midst is certainly far from unique: any European city Iâve ever been to has some version of the same thing surrounding its own architectural landmarks.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The difference with China is that the juxtaposition of old and new permeates lifestyles as much as it does civic planning, and in many cases itâs not so clear-cut which side, new or old, is the showpiece and which is for actual use.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Since leaving Xiâan I have traveled on two different trains.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The first was the Chinese version of the bullet train, whizzing along a high speed railway system completed only within the last ten years and claimed to be the fastest in the world.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The sleek white trains with pointed nose cones more associated with airplanes or rockets are smooth, clean, and elegant.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As are their new stations.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The Xiâan high speed rail station exudes might and modernity from every angle.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Entering from below by escalator, an enormous, beautiful and brightly lit hall stretches far beyond you.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">By the time you stand on the white marble floor and give your eyes a chance to gain perspective it is apparent that with a several thousand sloping seats this space could be one of the biggest arenas youâve ever set foot in.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And yet, at ten oâclock on a Friday morning, the place is virtually empty.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For all the money spent developing and constructing the future of Chinese inter-city transportation, hardly anyone seems to be using it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">While I was utterly impressed by the entire experience, apparently most Chinese travelers do not share my enthusiasm.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">High speed train tickets are expensive, their stations are located far from city centers, and a recent train crash and accusations of corruption by developers have soured the publicâs view of these futuristic locomotives.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I want to believe, as the Chinese government clearly does, that this investment was not made in vain, yet right now and to my great surprise, high speed trains in China look more like another expensive gimmick to impress foreigners than a genuine response to the desires of a growing number of Chinese travelers.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">So how does everyone get around?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">By overnight sleeper trains, of course!</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This was the second train I took since leaving Xiâan, and when compared to the ease and comfort of the first, it could not have been more different.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">My group and I were staying in the âhard sleeperâ class (as opposed to the âsoft sleeper,â which is how I got from Shanghai to Beijing), and hard is a pretty good adjective to describe the experience.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Stacked three-high on each side of narrow bays, tiny bunks became our homes for what felt like an interminable twenty-two hour train ride south.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I volunteered for the top bunk in a combination of chivalry toward the four girls to whom I ceded the lower and middle pair of bunks and a desire to excuse myself from any boredom abatement games they proposed to instead indulge in a new book that I had just started.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Unfortunately, the top bunk was not just higher up; it also had significantly less head clearance.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As a result I spent hours and hours on end propped at a shallow angle against the side of the train car reading my book - so long, in fact, that I developed a stiff back long before night fell and the conductors turned off the overhead lights and just-loud-enough-to-be-obnoxious Chinese music.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I spent the night turning over and over on my hard and narrow mattress, and each position in turn failed to reduce the sharp pain in my upper back as I so desperately hoped it would.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Eventually I did fall asleep, but when morning came my back was so sore I could hardly bear the routine of dragging my head diagonally across the train ceiling to reorient my body in order to climb down the ladder to the floor.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It is getting ever smaller and more crowded, and putting pressure on every minority or once-isolated culture that may once have prospered in seclusion.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But when modernity can come with a hand of appreciation, when the exchange of goods and ideas can be a two-way street, I think we can say weâre guiding this force in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yangshuo is a front line, as are thousands of other unique places that could be snuffed out by the pressures of overexposure if we donât take care.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yet I am not disheartened by what I saw there, because it gave me hope that both locals and people of influence like director Zhang Yi Mou recognize that there exists both value and methods of preserving it within this dreamlike landscape.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">To me the greater fear is not what is going on in Yangshuo, but what is going on in places we havenât had the great fortune of knowing, and for which there is not a clear avenue to preserve something of the past while simultaneiously building something for the future.</span></p>

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I have read these three words on the labels of clothing, electronics, cookware, toys, musical instruments â just about everything â for as long as I can remember.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In fact, I grew up knowing two facts about China long before any others: it is the most populous country in the world, and it is where everything is made.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Now that I am here, in the land that produced so many of the things Iâve enjoyed over the past twenty-eight years, I am perplexed by what to make of it all, because China appears to be spending its new treasure in an attempt to become more like the places it sends its exports and less like the proud and ancient country I have always imagined it to be.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Perhaps I expected China to be something of a mix of the two Asian countries I know best: India with its untamed vivacity laced through a complexly layered society, and Japan with its uniquely thoughtful modernity enjoyed by an industrious people.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">China is neither, but I still havenât figured out what it is instead.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">One indisputable truth about China, though, is that it has forever been the creator of thing the world wants.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">On the taxi ride from my arrival at the Shanghai Airport to my hotel in the city center I crossed a beautiful modern arched bridge over the Huangpu River with large Chinese characters written across the top of it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I asked my friend Kate, who studied Chinese in college, what it meant and she responded, âWelcome to Shanghaiâ¦ I think,â but I was already thinking of another bridge and chuckling to myself.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">A few miles from our college campus in New Jersey I remembered there being an old rusty railroad bridge over the Delaware River with huge letters on the side saying, âTrenton Makes, The World Takes.â</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">That slogan would be much more appropriate here.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I didnât come to China to be a consumer, but oddly, that quickly became the most fun thing to do in Shanghai.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After spending much of our first day wandering around what seemed to be more or less just another modern city with huge skyscrapers, I transformed into a sort of kid-in-a-candy-store when we entered the old town district.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Narrow streets bustled with the first serious crowds Iâd encountered since arriving, and the decorative red wood building fronts, hanging lanterns and tile roofs were unmistakably Chinese.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Small shops selling all sorts of traditional items â many for tourists but others clearly intended for local shoppers â occupied hundreds of narrow storefronts.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Before long I was haggling over the price of small wooden boxes, decorative fans, and small tapestries and paintings.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I joked to my friends, âThis was the best China Town Iâve ever seen!â</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Over the next two days my friends and I visited several other tourist destinations and commercial districts, but my favorite by far was our rather spontaneous trip to a silk factory and showroom.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We were greeted by a friendly young Chinese woman who asked if we were just there to shop or if we wanted to see the museum part of the factory that demonstrated how silk was made.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We quickly said weâd like to see the museum, and even though it was really just a two-room exhibit, the tour blew me away.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">To give a bit of context: growing up with a mother who is a weaver, knitter, cross-stitcher, and now an alpaca farmer, fabrics and fiber arts have always been a bit of a fascination to me, but I never knew how silk was made, aside from that it came from a silk worm.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In a mere ten minutes, my knowledge of and fascination with this material grew tenfold.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The first room of the museum showed the lifecycle of the silk worm, from tiny larvae to full-sized worm the size of a pinky finger to cocoon to large moth.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Petri dishes with real samples of each stage lined the wall next to a big graphical display.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, the only really unique part of this lifecycle was the cocoon, because thatâs where silk comes from.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The next room was where the mystery was revealed.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It just so happens that the entire cocoon of a silk worm is made of one continuous micro-thin, ultra-strong strand of silk, starting on the outside and ending on the inside where the worm becomes a moth.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It is possible, therefore, to find one end of the strand on the cocoonâs exterior and simply unravel it like pulling on the end of a ball of string.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">How this painstakingly tedious process could ever be replicated on an industrial scale, though, was still beyond me.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It turns out the method is both ingenious and shockingly simple.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After the silk worm finishes its cocoon but before it becomes a moth, approximately ninety percent of the cocoons are harvested and placed in hot water.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The water kills the worm and loosens the cohesion of the silk strand, making it possible to find the end.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Once that is done, eight cocoons are placed in one tiny hot water bath at the bottom of a wooden spinning wheel that simultaneously spins the eight strands together to produce a thicker, continuous thread and pulls up on the strands, allowing the weight of the cocoons to keep tension on the line.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As the wheel turns above, the eight cocoons simply tumble in the water as theyâre unraveled into nothing.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The machine in the demonstration room had a dozen such strands going at once, but it was not hard to imagine the same parallel lines of new silk thread stretching all the way across a large factory floor.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This process, of course, was invented thousands of years ago, and it is not an overstatement to say that it changed the world.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Silk was the latest Apple iProduct of its day, that special thing everyone with money wanted but couldnât make him or herself, and its day lasted over a millennium.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The silk trade spurred international commerce, attached its name to the first major link between East and West, and through the writings of Marco Polo and others cemented China as that wonderfully mysterious empire situated on the far side of the world.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This is not to say silk is no longer a lucrative trade today; to the contrary, silk still sells.Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I have been offered silk scarves, bed covers, table clothes, shirts, ties and suits to buy just about everywhere Iâve been so far in China.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Apparently the silk business is booming among all range of consumers too, because these items range in price from very expensive to dirt cheap.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Of course, half of these items are also not real silk.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In an ironic twist of modern commercialism, the same country that invented and prospered from silk, the finest fabric the world had ever known, has now perfected the art of imitating it, so much so that undiscerning tourists usually canât tell the difference.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Or maybe they just donât care.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The fact is, a part of modern tourism in China has become the ability to buy knock-offs of anything â designer handbags, watches, sunglasses, jeans â along with no-brand items of cheap make and material such as shoes, shirts, rugs, paintings or just about anything else you can imagine.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In the world of hyper-consumerism, cheap Chinese wares are the equalizer: your sunglasses can say Prada too for fifteen dollars, or ten if youâre a good haggler.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">A local guide even told my friends and me that she calls Beijingâs famous pearl market the âFake Marketâ because more fake stuff is sold there than real.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But what is fake, really, and what is real?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">A watch that tells time doesnât sound fake to me, but it also doesnât mean itâs a Breitling.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The same applies to a handbag with Louis Vuitton written on the side of it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But what about fake pearls?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Like silk, this deception is more than just false branding.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yet if a scarf keeps you warm or a necklace gets you compliments, does it matter if it comes from a silk worm, an oyster or just a highly processed vat of plastic?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This sort of deception seems benign enough to me, but I also wonder if it erodes more than just the exclusivity of certain brands or materials.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Does it also erode our integrity?</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">On my second day in Beijing my friends and I went to the Great Wall.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Of course, what makes the Great Wall so great is the fact that it stretches over six thousand kilometers from the ocean in the east to the far end of ancient China in the west.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Understandably given its incredible length, there are many different locations at which a tourist can go see the wall.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We chose a relatively new site to be opened for visitors, a section of the wall straddling a mountain pass just an hourâs drive north of the capital.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">When we got there I was instantly surprised by how well preserved this section of the wall was: all of the towers were in tact along with the gig saw ramparts and steep stairs.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As we climbed from the parking area upward, however, things started to look a bit strange to me, considering that this wall was supposedly hundreds of years old.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For one, from a higher vantage point one could easily see that the four-lane highway running perpendicular to the wall didn't pass over or under it, but neatly through perfectly sized arches made with stonework identical to that which we were climbing.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Secondly, the wall climbing up the ridge on the far side of the road disappeared half way up the distant hillside, perhaps ducking into another drainage, but nonetheless very different looking than the endless ridge top towers I had seen in so many pictures.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Finally, on the far side of the highest tower at the top of a very steep climb that only a small percentage of tourists reached, the wall abruptly stopped.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yes, it just stopped!</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I couldnât believe it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It was clear before then that extensive restoration of this part of the wall had been done before it was opened to tourists, but without even the ruins of an unrestored wall to trace before me to the horizon I began to wonder if there was any integrity in this site at all.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The idea of the Chinese government creating an entirely fake section of the Great Wall just for tourists would have disturbed me more had I not been forewarned of just this sort of thing by my friend whose family has worked in and concerning China for two generations.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Long embracing a culture of visual propaganda, the Chinese government became obsessed with presenting the perfect image of China to the world for the 2008 Olympic Games, and I am willing to bet that no matter what fortification historically existed on this site, its proximity to the city made it a prime target for government-sponsored beatification, and that its recent opening as a tourist destination coincided with the buildup to the Olympics.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Nevertheless, I kept mostly silent about my disgust for this fake wall while my friends were still here.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">There was no point in spoiling other peopleâs Great Wall experience based solely on a strong hunch.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After all, maybe all of the unrestored sections of the wall had simply disintegrated into the hills they once covered.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, three days later my suspicions were vindicated.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After my friends flew back to the United States, I joined a group tour with whom I will travel as far as Hong Kong, and our second dayâs activity was to travel to a remote section of the Great Wall three hours from Beijing and trek several miles along it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It only took minutes to understand upon seeing it that this was the real Great Wall.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Similar to the site I had visited earlier, evidence of heavy restoration existed near the entrance point.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, the farther we walked, the less and less restored the wall became and the more and more authentic it looked given its age.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">First most of the ramparts disappeared, and in their place the wall simply stopped like a cliff edge at either side.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Then the towers that dot the path of the wall every couple hundred yards and originally had second levels for lookouts became roofless shells of decaying walls and rubble.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Finally even the neatly placed steps and surface stones, perfectly erected in the restored sections, became piles of rubble with patches of grass growing from parts of them.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This was theÂ <em style="">real</em>Â wall, believably hundreds of years old, and even just before I stopped to turn around after hiking on it for several hours, when I looked forward I could easily see the wall stretched along the hillcrest, dotted with decaying tours like a line of silent sentries, all the way to the far off horizon.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">So why make fake things?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Why lie?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Why substitute a genuine experience for a fabricated one?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This is the biggest question I have for China.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After my first visit to the âGreat Wallâ I left feeling disappointed and confused, and certainly without any feeling of having witnessed greatness. I even remember thinking to myself, âWow, the Great Wall is nothing compared to the Taj Mahal or Machu Picchu.â</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, after my second visit, after seeing the real wall and walking along the remnants of the greatest military fortification and public works project in human history, I did appreciate the wallâs greatness and with it the people whose ancestors had built it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For me, at least, deception begets weakness and honesty begets greatness.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, as I rode the bus back to Beijing the next day and saw the outskirts of this huge city grow up around me I realized that perhaps my definition of real is just a point of view.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Stretching alongside the highway I saw dozens of new housing developments whose McMansion architecture and scale could have been pulled out of any affluent suburb in America.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yet those houses, complete with patios and two car garages, are homes to real Chinese families.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And within those houses, and houses just like them all over the world there are photographs from family vacations, maybe even to the Great Wall of China.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Was that vacation not real just because the wall everyone is sanding on is simply a replica of a historic building and not the real thing?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Are the silk pajamas containing only ten percent silk or plastic pearls with dust adhered to them to give that slightly rough pearl feel any less of a gift if it is just the thought that counts?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I may be in a minority, but I say thereÂ <em style="">is</em>Â a difference, and thereÂ <em style="">is</em>Â a loss of value whether the ultimate recipient can recognize it or not.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Because every time we dilute something, every time we say something is real when it is in fact fake, we lose the ability to witness and understand true greatness.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Silk is great, the Great Wall is great, and China has been and can be great too.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yet somehow, somewhere, someone decided instead to make China the land of fake things that can be consumed cheaply.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Be the silk factory, China, be the inventors of paper and rockets.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After an amazing month in Australia I once again find myself nestled into a window seat of a packed airliner flying high over a mixture of land and ocean below me.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">My tour of Australia, in which I came to know two amazing cities, crossed the vast openness of the Outback, and explored the beauty and majesty of the Great Barrier Reef and the North Queensland Coast, was exactly what I needed at exactly the right time.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After the complete sensory overload of India, Australia just felt like an elongated traditional vacation: relaxing, exciting, scenic, but also easy.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In fact, my only regret flying away from Australia is that this amazing continentâs remoteness will keep me from finding casual excuses to return as frequently as I would wish to do so.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Even on my last day, as I walked with my friends along the much-recommended and truly breathtaking path from Coogee to Bondi Beaches in Sydney, I once again had to stop and ask why I would ever leave this place now that I had discovered it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The truth is, however, I am more excited than ever to go home, and the reason is that I finally know what it is I intend to go home to.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Iâve spent much of the last six months since leaving my previous life and employment trying to figure out what should be the next chapter of my life.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">From arranging fact-finding phone calls in Ecuador to completing graduate school applications in Dubai to discussing pros and cons of business schools or consulting jobs with an old college friend in Mumbai to impatiently waiting for admission decisions in southern India, the question âWhat is next?â has consumed so much of my thought and reflection for a very long time.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But finally, after all of this thinking, discussing, waiting and rethinking, I have reached a decision, and I could not feel better about it:</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I have decided to move to Santa Barbara, California and to start a manufacturing company, which ironically enough is the same thing I told people I intended to do six months ago when I left my previous job, though at that time it just happened to be the leading contender among so many possible ideas.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">So what allowed me to come to this decision and what makes me so happy about it?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I know there must be many factors, but one indisputable cause has simply been spending such a significant amount of time away.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yes, in many ways it took getting far, far away from both my pervious life and all the other distractions that surrounded it to see both myself and my many options for the future in a better light.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Also, as someone heavily influenced by the opinions of those I am closest to, it has been invaluable to spend large periods of time alone or with only one or two close friends.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The result has been a steadily growing understanding of what I really want alongside a steadily growing confidence in my own ability to succeed at whatever it is I choose to pursue.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Whereas six months ago I knew I wanted to start a company eventually but hadnât the courage to actually take the plunge, I now feel quite the opposite, and I can only deduce that some unforeseen consequence of all the experiences, adventures, challenges and tribulations that I have exposed myself to between then and now has been this new sense of confidence I have in myself.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The funny thing about it, though, is that I didnât believe this sort of change was possible as a result of travel alone, and I Â even went so far as to dismiss the search for it through travel by others.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">So many people I have encountered while traveling, be they backpackers in South America or hippies in India or year-long work visa holders in Australia, left home to âfind themselvesâ and to âfind their callingâ in the world.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This was never my intention, and I viewed their quests as being as likely to succeed as a Hail Mary pass in football.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In fact, I originally never intended to travel for so long â my plan grew from a mere three-week vacation to India to coincide with my sisterâs wedding reception in January.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, when I spoke with friends about my plan to take some time between jobs to travel they wisely pointed out that I would never again have this amount of freedom for long-duration travel, so I began adding destinations and recruiting several of these same friends to join me for different legs.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Duration was simply a matter of pragmatism, and likewise the goals of my travel were totally external and in my mind pragmatic as well: to discover something about the world by taking a series of long exposure looks at different corners of it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I never intended for the lens to point inward, and I certainly never expected to discover as much about myself as the places I would visit.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I suppose in this way I was the naÃ¯ve one, because even in the short history of my own life I should have recognized the inherent personal value of getting away and seeing the world from a different angle.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">When I was seventeen I studied abroad for a semester in a small town in Normandy, France, and ever since I have looked back on that experience as my intellectual renaissance and the time when I started to think of myself as an adult.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Well, I cannot say exactly how I will look back on this period of travel, but with the still-blurry perspective of being right next to it I can already tell it will be something similar to that of eleven years ago.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After nearly six months of travel through South America, India and Australia I feel so good about what I have done and all the unexpected gifts I have taken away from this journey.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It is the way everyone should hope to feel at the end of such a long trip, and thus I am so thankful to be feeling it now.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In a few hours my airplane will land and the next chapter will begin.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But of course, by this I do not meanÂ <em style="">the</em>Â next chapter, the one Iâve been obsessing over for so long.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">What I mean is China!</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yes, amazingly I still have one last great adventure in front of me on this journey, and I can only guess what more gifts I will find there.</span></p>

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yet over the last two weeks, as I covered five thousand kilometers of rural highway through one of the most sparsely populated regions on the planet not covered by ocean, ice or sand, my mind opened, as if put in a trance by the endless flat landscapes and straight roads upon them, and through this opening seemingly every thought, fear and aspiration for my future came rolling to the forefront of my consciousness, squawking for attention like little baby birds and vying to be first to jump out of the nest of my mind and into the air of my ultimate action.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The fact is, after traveling nonstop for five and a half months, I am finally approaching the end.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">One month from today I will board an airplane in Hong Kong and return to the United States.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">A blank page awaits me, and it is as terrifying as it is exhilarating.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">First was the simple yet powerful force of distraction.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">When I spent my days dodging traffic on crowded Indian highways, marveling over centuries-old palaces and tombs, or exploring lively modern cities my mind was full enough.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">By contrast, the Australian Outback is an area so flat, huge and homogenous that from one distant horizon to another the most exciting change may be the presence of slightly more trees or a new species of grass upon the plane.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Second was the illusion of endless time.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Why worry about a decision that need not be made for months when there are so many more fun things to think about in the present?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Daydream or ponder?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Sure, I did plenty of that in regard to my future plans, but I never had to decide anything.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In fact, I couldnât have even decided anything if Iâd wanted to because too many variables such as which graduate schools would admit me still existed a few months ago.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Now all of that is rapidly changing, and the time to move from pondering to deciding is upon me.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Another unavoidable contributor to my newly focused contemplation has been sharing this great overland trek with two great friends facing similar question about their futures.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">My friend Lane, with whom I shared the drive from Melbourne to Alice Springs, is quitting his job at the end of the year and knows only that he doesnât want to stay in Hawaii where he currently lives.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">From Alice Springs onward Iâve traveled with my best college friend, Kate, who is also weighing graduate school or changing jobs against staying at her current firm.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Sitting next to these two friends in the cab of our RV for ten hours or more, day after day, put every subject on the table, and nothing came up more frequently or more intensely than our respective hopes and concerns for the next stages of our lives.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">While obviously these sorts of conversations can and do happen anywhere, I also believe now, at the far end of my Outback crossing, that sometimes it takes a special combination of isolation and pleasant monotony to let the process of discernment take its due course.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Life can â and generally does â move too fast to stop and take stock of what you really want and how you really want to move toward it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">So even though I did more exciting things over the past fourteen days than stare ahead at the slowly changing scenery alongside a generally dead-straight road, it was that soaking up of the rugged, beautiful, open, unspoiled, almost dreamlike expanses, greater in size than even most countries of the world, that allowed me to take stock of my own dreams and aspirations and to face the future I have known for a long time awaits me at the end of this journey with a newfound confidence and resolve.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Did I need to come all the way to this remote part of the world to achieve this feeling?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Perhaps not, but it is nevertheless where I found it, and because of this I know the Australian Outback and my journey across it will hold a special place in my memory for a long time to come.</span></p>

</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I (heart) Sydney.Â  I had already been in the city for two days when I first saw this T-shirt on a fellow tourist while wandering the scenic, sloping pathways of Toronga Zoo on the north side of Sydney Harbor.Â  It was a beautiful sunny day, and spending the prime hours of it looking at koalas, kangaroos, and an impressive collection of poisonous snakes in my first visit to a zoo since high school felt all too fitting for a stay in Sydney that was already engendering feelings of infatuation I thought had gone the way of adolescence within me.Â  By day three Sydney had me in the palm of its hand, and after seeing that T-shirt, I kept repeating it both in my head and out loud to anyone who would listen for the remainder of my five-day visit there.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Part of this must have been because of where I had just come form.Â  Landing in Sydney on a Friday night, I was instantly overwhelmed by a feeling of normalcy and ease after spending the previous two months motorcycling through India.Â  Things just made sense again: customs, baggage claim, the local commuter train, the presence of crosswalks and traffic lights, and the lack of honking and choking traffic.Â  Sydney was doing well in my mind even before I stepped foot into the hostel where my American friend Lane was meeting me, but I hadnât seen anything yet.Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For starters, the hostel we were staying at was unlike any lodging by a similar label I had ever experienced before.Â  While Lane and IÂ <em style="">were</em>Â sharing a modest sized room with six other people, the facilities were nicer than those in most of the hotels Iâd stayed at during my previous travels in India and South America.Â  The beds were comfortable, the floors had new carpeting, the walls were freshly painted, and most importantly: the bathrooms were large, clean, and supplied with inexhaustible high-pressure hot water (a true novelty after my recent travels).Â  Downstairs there was a spacious lobby with computers and phones, a cafÃ© that served tasty meals and sandwiches, a street-corner patio to enjoy some early evening drinks, and even a nightclub (albeit, dominated by the twenty-one and under crowd) in the basement! Â When I described it the next day to an Australian friend with whom I had traveled in South America I said, âThis place has died and gone to Hostel Heaven.â</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After checking in, dropping off my luggage on a bottom bunk bed of my new room and heading back downstairs, I was immediately introduced to two Dutch girls and an American guy Lane had just befriended while sipping wine on the corner patio, waiting for me to arrive.Â  Two of them werenât even staying at the hostel, but had just come to its bar to hang out, and before long the five of us were off to grab a late dinner at a nearby pub where we enjoyed the cool evening air and good company until nearly midnight.Â  Before we parted ways the one Dutch girl who actually lives in Sydney invited us all to a barbeque/house party she and her Czech friend were throwing the following evening in a nearby neighborhood.Â  At this point I had been on the ground less than four hours and I had already been invited to what would become an evening of more good olâ fashion fun than I had had since leaving Cuenca, Ecuador over three months before.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Over the next couple days Lane and I walked all over the city: down clean gridded streets, past modern shopping complexes, through mature gardens and parks, and along the ever-curving shoreline of Sydneyâs multi-fingered harbor and scenic beaches.Â  The landscape was so eerily serene and its citizens so shockingly polite and helpful, I could hardly believe I was at the heart of a metropolis more than half the size of New York City.Â  Friendly service, a diverse selection of food, and the taste of beer not named Kingfisher topped off the easing of my mindset from adventure traveler to indulgent vacationer, and the transition could not have felt better.Â Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Sydney impressed me more than simply showing me a good time, though.Â  Beyond its beautiful skyline, beautiful natural scenery, and equally beautiful people, Sydney also showed me a lifestyle that, in sharp contrast to that of places I had thus far traveled along my world tour, appeared not only to be so much in line with that which I would hope to soon enjoy after I complete my travels, but also remarkably achievable for both Australians and the myriad European and North American expatriates who also call Sydney home.Â  I met Dutch, Czechs, Canadians, Germans, Irish, French, Greeks and New Zealanders who all appeared to move as full members of this city that sits contently at the edge of the world.Â  And it was through their eyes, or at least what I imagined their perspectives to be, that another thought crept silently into my mind, one wholly unexpected when I arrived just a few days before: Sydney could be my home too.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Not just in the past few months, but over all of my twenty-eight years I have had the great fortune to visit and experience, either for a couple days or for a year or longer, hundreds of different cities and towns that are not my home.Â  Iâve lived abroad twice, traveled abroad countless times, and come to know many cities that inspire people to move great distances to be apart of.Â  Yet for all the Parisâs, Romes, Londons, and New York Cities I have encountered, I could not remember one stinging me quite the way Sydney had in my brief stay there, and I could not shake this thought during the dayâs train ride away from Sydney as Lane and I continued our Australian tour toward Melbourne.Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Melbourne is Australiaâs second largest city and a place some even claim to enjoy more than Sydney. Â In my mind, however, it was doomed upon my arrival to play second fiddle to her flashy older sister, so I was not surprised when I quickly determined that while also clean, friendly, nicely laid out, and possessing an even better public transportation system than Sydneyâs, Melbourne could never come close to wowing me to the same degree I had just been.Â  In keeping with this assessment, and also realizing there are no must-see tourists stops like Sydneyâs Opera House or Bondi Beach, Lane and I took the next two days to simply wander Melbourneâs various neighborhoods, enjoy good food, do a bit of shopping, and catch up on those often overlooked travel necessities like laundry and corresponding with people from back home.Â  Yet while doing all this, once again Lane and I both found ourselves strangely under the spell of how nice of a place Melbourne was.Â  âIs this just because I came here straight from India?â I remember asking him.Â  âNo,â he said confidently, âI just came fromÂ <em style="">Hawaii</em>Â and I think this place is amazing.â</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">On our last two evenings in Melbourne we had the great fortune to go out with locals, the first being a recent friend of mine from my travels in South America, and the second being an old friend of Laneâs with whom he taught English in Istanbul.Â  On the first night we met my friend for dumplings in Melbourneâs quaint China Town and then went to a preseason match of Australian Rules Football, or âFootyâ as the locals call it.Â  Lane and I quickly ingratiated ourselves to surrounding fans (though to the unfortunate embarrassment of our hostess) with our boisterous and enthusiastic support of the home team, all the while only vaguely understanding the rules and strategy of the game.Â  It was a truly Melbournean experience that I am certain to remember fondly whenever I see the rare Australian Rules Football highlight on SportsCenter back home.Â  The following night, however, turned out to be even more enjoyable, and in true Melbourne fashion this was despite its comparative ease and simplicity.Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We met Laneâs friend Lou at a funky little cafÃ©/bar in what she immediately described to us as not only her home neighborhood, but also the cityâs hipster district, and after some general introductions and catching up she proposed a delightful little plan for the evening: a pub crawl to some of her favorite local spots.Â  Over the next seven hours we went to an equal number of truly unique pubs and bars, any one of which would have been my favorite place to go out in the last city I lived in.Â  There was a brightly lit, high aluminum ceilinged micro-brew warehouse that conjured images of a modern German beer hall filled with large wooden picnic-style tables and benches and surrounded by a few high tables with stools.Â  From there we went to a haggard saloon that could have been straight out of the American Southwest.Â  Playing there, just feet before a cliental averaging at least forty-years-old, was a blues band of the same dimensions: weathered, talented, and with a leather-clad vocalist sporting red lipstick brighter than Iâve ever seen, at least on someone her age.Â  She ended the set with a soulful rendition of âFly me an angel down from Montgomeryâ that would have made my night all by itself.Â  From there we went to an outdoor eatery with its kitchen in an Airstream trailer, a practically unmarked local wood paneled pub, an old distillery-turned-tapas restaurant, and a speakeasy styled bar accessed only by walking up a narrow unmarked stairwell at the back of a different speakeasy styled bar.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Not only was the eclectic variety of venues thoroughly enjoyable, so was the ease of conversation with everyone I met, especially Lou.Â  As she described her life in Melbourne to me â her job, her friends, her plans for her upcoming wedding (sheâs hoping to hold it at the Airstream eatery), it once again became apparent that Melbourne is another city in which I too could build a happy life.Â  She even drove the point home: if I really am as un-tied down as I say I am, why not consider Melbourne as a real option?Â  So many other foreigners, especially English speaking ones, come to Australia; why couldnât I?Â  I told her Iâd think on it, but even before the cab ride back to my hotel and my conversation on the same topic with Lane, I began to recognize the real desire within me, and it had less to do with any individual place than I had first recognized.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The more I think about it the more I am certain that what I want is not to live in Sydney or Melbourne at all.Â  What I really want is theÂ <em style="">life</em>Â I witnessed in both cities and a connection to a place I wonât soon be leaving.Â  I want to love the neighborhood I walk around on a Saturday afternoon.Â  I want to love the bar I go to on a Friday night.Â  I want to love the friends I meet just because we live down the street from each other, and I want to love the local sports, culture and festivals that make my city unique.Â  I also want to feel like I am a part of a community that looks at the world and our role within it in a similar way to how I do.Â  This is what I saw in both Sydney and Melbourne.Â  And unlike seeing another man with a beautiful and fun girlfriend or wife and thinking jealously, âHow nice would it be to have her in my life,â with a city I actuallyÂ <em style="">could</em>Â have the exact same city as another without depriving anyone else of anything.Â  So yes, I was taken in by the charms of these two admittedly wonderful cities, and knowing that they are here, knowing that should I strike out at finding a similar life back in America they will be here with arms open, is great to know and a great option to have, even if I intend never to exercise it.

was a very bold undertaking, and at several points throughout my second month
there, and certainly during the vast majority of my last week, all I wanted to
do was what I am doing right now: be on an airplane flying far, far away.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This feeling did not come from a dislike of
India, Indians or Indian culture, but instead from the simple exhaustion of cultural
overload, which left me and my traveling companions craving our own brand of
normalcy and woefully unable to find it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â 
</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Language barriers, honking horns, cold showers and a hundred other minor
differences or inconveniences were all quite manageable when we were fresh and
eager to experience something new, but at the end of a hard three day ride, or
more specifically after weeks of traveling through a country we didnât really
understand, any one of those could be the straw that broke the camelâs back and
make us internally declare, âIâm so over this place!â and find the best way to
distract ourselves away, be it a book, a movie, a phone call home, or just a
stiff drink.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Certainly the way in which we chose to see India exposed us
to this sort of overload more than a traditional traveler.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Traveling by motorcycle was such an amazing
way to not just see India, but to really participate in India, and every single
time I spoke with another western tourist I recognized how much more of India I
was experiencing by traveling in this way.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â 
</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, it also meant that for days at a time I was exposed to 100%
India â all around me, and at times even barreling toward me in the form of a
ten-ton bus in my lane of the highway.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â 
</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">On the road, and even at many of the less-visited towns we stayed in
along the way, there was no tourist quarter or obvious path for us to follow.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Life in these parts of India felt like a full
contact sport, and we were jumping right in the middle of it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">So as much as one would think that completing our motorcycle
trip in the southern city of Trivandrum three days ago would have been an
affair of proud jubilation, excited exploration of our long awaited
destination, and smiley group photos, in reality it was more like the huge
exhale and the half crippled walk I remember from the end of a marathon I ran a
few years back.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">While both were
unforgettable and rewarding experiences on the whole, at the time of completion
the only thing I wanted to do in either case was be done, find a comfortable
bed, and stay in it as long as I could fathom.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â 
</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">To that end Trivandrum did oblige us: a day long transportation strike shut
down the entire city the day after we arrived, so after returning our
motorcycles to the man meeting us there from Delhi we spent the balance of the
day in our hotel room watching American movies, ordering room service, and
surfing the internet via remarkably fast in-room WIFI.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">When it came to say goodbye to Nick and Mike
the next morning as I left the hotel to catch my early flight to Mumbai, none
of us had much more to say to each other than a brief, âso longâ or âhave a
good one.â</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">They didnât even get out of
bed to see me off, and I didnât even care.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â 
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Thatâs the part of adventuring nobody told me about, and I
suppose itâs because it doesnât fit with a great story or a Hollywood script:
the inglorious ending.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As much as so
many travelers say they want a âtrue adventureâ Iâm not so sure they really
do.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Because a true adventure challenges
you, changes you, exposes your weaknesses, prejudices and limitations, and
leaves you if not slightly wounded, certainly weathered, exhausted and
isolated.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">People think adventure means
fun, and yes, they often coexist, but they are far from the same thing. </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Seeing the sun rise on the Taj Mahal is fun
whereas motorcycling 5000 kilometers across India is an adventure. </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Adventure is really a full contact sport, and
while being on the field is certainly where I wanted to be, it isnât always as
fun or as easy to walk away from as watching from the sidelines.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">So why do I continue?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â 
</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Why am I an hour from landing in Sydney, Australia and not Los Angeles
or New York?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Two reasons really.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">First, and by design in the order I chose to
visit countries, Australia promises to be a welcome break from many of the challenges
and cultural differences I encountered in India.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But secondly, as travel-weary and fatigued as
I felt only days ago, I also trusted that as with almost every other measure,
human resilience is our greatest characteristic.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â  </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Sure enough, after forty-eight hours of
lounging around hotels and another fourteen hours in airplanes, I do feel
refreshed, I do feel recharged, and I am as eager as ever to embark on another great
trip in another great setting.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span></p>

</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Traveling is a funny thing.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">People who are normally accustomed to an established level of comfort and convenience provided by access to their various possessions decide to leave almost all of that behind and go to another location where they have to either rent access on a temporary basis to replacement items (bed, car, kitchen, etc.) or go without a degree of comfort and convenience (air conditioning, internet, etc.) for a duration of their travel.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Life is therefore inevitably more difficult while traveling than at oneâs home.Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">To mitigate this barrow-or-go-without burden, however, travelers universally do another otherwise peculiar thing: they select a sub-set of their most prized and mobile possessions, those that theyâre least willing to go without while away from home, and stuff them into backpacks, suitcases, handbags, duffel bags, and even clothing pockets in order to bring with them on their journeys.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">These items are the not-live-withouts, the select few in lifestyles filled with possessions, and much thought goes into what makes the list and just how much burden it is worth to have access to all these things at all times.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Iâve packed twice so far for my travels, once for South America before Christmas and again for India, Australia and China after Christmas, and both times I strove to only bring that which I would really need.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yet no matter how sparing I attempted to be in my selection process, I inevitably packed some items that simply sit in the bottom of my duffel bag at each stop along the way and rarely if ever get used.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The thing is, packing is a form of guesswork: you make assumptions about what a place youâve never been to will be like, and from those assumptions you decide what youâll want most and what will be most difficult to purchase or barrow.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">One wildly inaccurate assumption I made was how difficult laundry service would be.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I imagined that I would be washing underwear and shirts in hotel bathroom sinks along the way, so I purchased clothing made of quick drying fabric instead of regular cotton.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Once I started traveling, though, I realized any touristy town has a laundry services available, and getting clothes washed is usually as simple as dropping them off one day and paying a modest sum of money when you pick them up the next.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Another false assumption I made was that the Andes would be really cold, so I brought a sweatshirt, a thin down jacket, a leather jacket and a raincoat with me, half of which I could have left at home.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Other assumptions, however, led to excellent packing decisions.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For instance, I knew I would want a full sized computer on which to surf the internet, write my blog, and edit photographs and videos.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I also knew that I didnât want to lug around anything very heavy, so I purchased a top of the line MacBook Air (the single most expensive thing I have with me by far), and it has been amazingly convenient and useful.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I also assumed that I wouldnât be able to buy a comfortable motorcycle helmet (I have a ridiculously large head) or a specialized armor-padded riding jacket or gloves in Ecuador or India, so at a great expense of space in my duffel bag I purchased those items stateside and brought them with me.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This turned out to be a great call not only for the sake of comfort, but also because both times I have fallen off my motorcycle (once going up a steep muddy road in Ecuador, and the other when a previously parked rickshaw abruptly pulled out and blocked my lane in India) my protective gear spared me any physical harm and allowed me to simply shake off the incident and continue on my way.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Other prized items have been purchased along the way.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After getting a sunburn during a forty-five minute outdoor Spanish lesson during my first week in Cuenca, Ecuador, I realized the combination of high altitude, equatorial sunshine that cuts through the atmosphere at a right angle and my pale skin were not going to bode well over the next two months, so I bought a Panama hat at the local hat factory and wore it every sunny day until I left it on a bus in Salta, Argentina two days before leaving South America.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Similarly, when I found myself chilly in the tiny town of Pushkar in Northern India I purchased a thin maroon and orange striped blanket to wrap myself in.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">While I always expected to discard it once I left the cold desert nights of Rajasthan, I have kept âPushkar blacket,â as it is now affectionately called, and I still use it frequently on cold nights in hotels that often give me nothing more than a top sheet on my bed.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Items people bring with them while traveling are chosen according to their assumed value, and they are then used according to their actual value.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Those items with a lot of the former and little of the latter are the ones that find their ways to the bottom of our backpacks and suitcases and may undertake an entire journey unused.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Items of the opposite sense are almost never brought and are then either dearly missed or purchased along the way.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But the underlying question remains: what is valueÂ <em style="">really</em>?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Value is almost certainly not the purchase price of an item once it is bought, because almost nothing we own or bring with us will ever be resold.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For instance, I spent hours trying to recover my Panama hat after I left it in Salta, even though shipping it to Buenos Aires would have easily exceeded the twenty-five dollars I paid for it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">On the other hand, if you stole the fifty dollar pair of dark pants Iâve been carrying around unworn for the last two months I might not even notice for several days and certainly wouldnât be very upset.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But then again, just because something isnât used frequently doesnât mean it isnât important.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">That perspective changed dramatically after Nickâs and my first outing to Patiala and back for my sisterâs wedding reception.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Those two days of riding were extremely unpleasant, in large part because on both occasions we got horribly lost and then even more confused when well intentioned but nevertheless equally clueless Indians tried to give us directions.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Things that would have been laughably easy in the United States such as finding a major highway or locating an address in a major city were infuriatingly difficult for someone who didnât speak Hindi, and between that and the no-rules traffic of Indian roads, Nick and I seriously considered giving up on the entire motorcycle tour before it ever really began.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Instead we decided to continue, at least on the train to Varanasi, on the condition that we purchased a GPS, as had been recommended by my sisterâs new brother-in-law at the wedding reception.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Sure enough, MapMyIndia changed everything.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">At the beginning Nick and I kept our motorcycles on major highways, so we really only needed directions at the beginning of each day to find the highway leaving a particular city and then again at the end of the day to find whatever hotel we had picked from a guidebook or MapMyIndiaâs built-in database.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But even that was huge.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Gone was the mystery of weaving through tiny, overcrowded roads hoping the directions given to us were accurate or that we were still on the right path.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Gone was the need to stop, inevitably attract a crowd of at least eight people, ask them how to get someplace, wait for them to discuss it among themselves, and then discern the consensus or most credible recommendation from their broken English.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This was even more important in the evenings when a sore body from a long dayâs ride and anxiety over a soon-to-be-setting sun made tempers short and the need to be off the motorcycles as great as ever for everyoneâs health and sanity.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">MayMyIndia didnât change the roads or reduce the dangers we dealt with daily upon them, but it did something almost as great: it removed the uncertainty, and that made a previously unbearable experience manageable.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This is because here in Southern India it has made possible entire journeys we never would have attempted without it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Ever since Nick and I met up with our friend Mike in Goa, our motorcycle touring has taken on a decidedly different pace and style.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Whereas the first month of our tour was dictated by an ever-present need to reach a certain city by a certain date, leaving Goa we had three weeks to travel a comparatively short distance to the city of Trivandrum, our ending point at the southern tip of India.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Along with this, the obvious tourist trail that Nick and I had been following from Varanasi through Agra, Rajasthan, and Mumbai more or less ends in Goa.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">There was no obvious next destination aside from Karela, the state of which Trivandrum is the capital, and so with time to simply explore Southern India, we made plans the old fashioned way: the day before we wanted to leave a place we looked up surrounding cities in our secondhand Lonely Planet guidebook, found something that looked interesting, and then simply plugged the destination into MapMyIndia the next morning.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Has MapMyIndia ever met the challenge too!</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Whereas three quarters of our traveling prior to Goa had been on four-lane highways, leaving Goa we didnât see anything wider than two lanes until yesterday when we reached the port city of Kochi in central Kerala, over a thousand kilometers of riding later.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">MapMyIndia has taken us over deserted forest passes, through mile after mile of rice fields on narrow country lanes, and down one lane roads that reminded me more of fire lanes in a forested park than the state highways they purported to be.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Leaving the coast to visit the ancient imperial capital of Hampi we traveled through tiny villages and small towns and watched coastal forest turn to inland desert one unmarked intersection at a time.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">While we often questioned whether MapMyIndia had decided to turn us off a nicely paved highway onto a poorly maintained road in order to shave off just a few kilometers, we have never actually been let down by its navigation.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We have always reached our destination, and the confidence gained therein has let us repeat our blind obedience and day-by-day planning.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The culmination of thisÂ <em style="">very</em>Â off the beaten path travel was witnessing the annual Kampala, or water buffalo races, outside the city of Mangalore in the southwestern corner of the state of Karnataka.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Mangalore, though a reasonably sized port city, wasnât even recognized as a destination when we tried to explain it the day before we arrived to hotel workers who were convinced we were talking about Bangalore instead.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Nevertheless, our butchered pronunciation didnât keep MapMyIndia from knowing where we wanted to go, and so just as we had planned for over two weeks, the day before Kampala was set to begin, we arrived in Mangalore after yet another day of crisscrossing local Indian roads and highways.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The next day, this time with the help of a local taxi driver, we made our way to the Fajir Bus Stand â literally a bus stand thirty kilometers outside Mangalore where we had read online that Kampala was being held.Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">With our driver asking final directions from passersby and a building excitement within the cab that we might actually achieve the seemingly unachievable, our way continued from a two lane paved road to a one lane paved road to a one lane dirt road toâ¦ amazingly, in the complete middle of nowhere, an open field filled with parallel one hundred twenty-meter-long mud tracks, dozens of harnessed buffalo teams, andÂ <em style="">five thousand</em>Â local spectators.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Kampala was by far the most unique thing Iâve witnessed in India, and easily one of the most unique things Iâve witnessed during all of my travels so far.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For the six hours we were there, and through the night and into the morning thereafter, teams of two male water buffalos, singularly for a clocked time or side by side for head-to-head matchups, sprinted down a track of eight-inch-deep water with a man holding a tether in one hand and wielding a bamboo cane in the other dashing behind them, yelling, beating, and trying not to be pulled over.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Along the raised sidewalls of the track, spectators crowded behind a rope barrier, vying for the best view of the action.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Nick, Mike and I were also the only non-Indians there.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Our conspicuousness, however, played to our unintended advantage when the announcer standing under a grandstand for VIPs suddenly switched into English and started saying, âMy friendsâ¦ my friendsâ¦â while gesturing toward us.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Before we knew it, we were offered front row seats in under a colored tarp surrounded by the local elders and business owners who financed the competition.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In that way the uniqueness of the spectacle before us was matched only by the warm reception and genuine hospitality of the eventâs hosts, for whom the presence of three awe-struck Americans was an obvious source of pride in what they countless times described as their âown traditional cultureâ with happy smiles on their faces.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The entire day we were at Kampala, MapMyIndia sat charging in our hotel room back in Mangalore.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Nevertheless, I know beyond any doubt that without MapMyIndia we would never have made it across hundreds of miles of Indian back roads on motorcycles to be in just the right place on just the right day to witness such an event.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">MapMyIndia, though just a simple GPS console, has opened up the rest of India to us.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It has allowed us to pull back the curtain and see the real India, the India behind that witnessed at major tourist destinations.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">When I was in Goa I met an Italian woman about my age on a riverboat ride at one of the most touristy places I have been in India.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">She explained to me that she had spent a few days in Mumbai and a week in Goa, and that after those two places she felt like sheâd really gotten a feel for India and that she was checking it off her list of places to travel.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I tried not to laugh.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I certainly donât want to tell anyone else how to see a new country, especially one as huge and diverse and challenging as India.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But to think that you haveÂ <em style="">seen</em>Â India â to think that you even begin toÂ <em style="">know</em>Â orÂ <em style="">understand</em>Â India after skipping from one tourist destination to anther is a laughable notion.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Over the last seven weeks I would say Iâve gotten an excellentÂ <em style="">sampling</em>Â of what India is.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And over the last two weeks, in large part because of the confidence Iâve had to strike out into the heartland of Southern India, I would say I have come to really appreciate the diversity and culture of this region.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">That is what MapMyIndia has done for me.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">My computer keeps me connected, my motorcycle jacket keeps me safe, my Panama hat kept my face shaded, and my rain pants kept me dry and mobile.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It gave confidence to do what I never would have done otherwise.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We love to drive fast even when the speed limit tells us not to.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, we do have at least an outward appearance of concern for traffic safety where I come from, and in a most remarkable demonstration of this, some of us even drive with our lights on during the day to increase our visibility to other drivers.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The trend is so popular, in fact, that new cars even have the option to run their headlights during the daytimeÂ <em style="">automatically</em>!</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And that makes me feel just a little bit safer here on the roads of India.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">So while I continue my motorcycle tour through southern India over the next two weeks, I ask only that you consider this: there are many cultural difference between us that get played out on the roads, and almost all of these are mine to bear.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">To me, the presence of cows, ox-carts, auto-rickshaws, vehicles going the wrong way on a divided highway, vehicles going the wrong way on a two-lane road, an endless game of chicken with passing trucks and busses, unannounced potholes or speed bumps deep or tall enough to bottom out the shocks of my motorcycle and bounce me off my seat, pedestrians crossing the road no matter its size or density of traffic, herds of animals crossing the road no matter its size or density of traffic, and so many other differences are still rather new and startling to me.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And like I said, adjusting to these differences is my burden to bear.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But cultural exchange is also like any road in India (whether so designated or not): it is a two-way street.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And when it comes to the burden of a few extra photons originating not from the reflected sun but from the bulb of my headlight hitting your eyes as you watch me appear around a corner or over the horizon on a long desert highway, that one is all you.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Sorry, India, Iâm not turning off my headlight, and youâre just going to have to deal with it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent;

</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I cannot remember the last time I was so sedentary â a time when I did so little day in and day out â and certainly not a time when I felt so guilt free and deserving of inactivity as I have over the past week.Â Â Since leaving Cuenca, Ecuador on November 19th, I have not slept in any one locationÂ longer than five days.Â Â That is, until this past week.Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For the last seven days I have stayed in a one-room shack a stoneâs throw from the gently breaking surf of Mandrem Beach in Goa, India.Â Â For two of those days I never even left the quarter mile stretch of beach directly in front of my shack and the adjoining open air restaurant, and for another two I made only brief outings to eat dinner or to recharge my cellphone minutes and buy whatever after-sun lotion my friend and I could find in the nearby village.Â Â The sum total of a dayâs work has been waking up around nine, eating breakfast, reading a book, strolling down the beach to the nearest shack cafÃ© with wireless internet, laying out in the sun (that is, pre-sunburn â this was replaced by actively avoiding the sun after my locally bought, so-called SPF 50 sunscreen failed me miserably and led to the worst sunburn Iâve suffered in years), playing in the waves, eating again, watching a DVD on my laptop, and then drinking a few beers with my friends in the evening with perhaps another meal, depending of how late and heavy my lunch had been.Â Â Yet despite the meager amount of activity that comprised each day here, at the end of every one I returned to my shack, covered my semi-comfortable and now quite sandy bed with a mosquito net, and slept to the sound of crashing waves until long after sunrise the following day.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The odd thing about being sedentary, though, is that it too required an adjustment, not so differently than any other transition I have made in my travels so far.Â Â At first the newness was welcomed: Nick and I gave each other high fives and a congratulatory hug when we first walked over the dune to witness our long-anticipated Goan prize.Â Â Then it was questioned: two days into being here I was a strong proponent of pushing down the coast until a day of exploration revealed that we had, in large part by dumb luck, already found one of Goaâs nicest beaches on our first stop.Â Â And finally it was embraced: I came to understand that though our beach was filled almost entirely with Russian tourists to whom we couldnât talk, a beach this nice doesnât come along every day, so even though our hopes of making new friends or finding a local party scene were dashed, the sheer beauty and convenience of this location couldnât be beat.Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The strangest thing about being here has been the amount of time to be alone with my thoughts, completely uninterrupted by the ever-changing scenery, or worse by the life-threatening traffic, that previously demanded my attention over the last weeks and months.Â Â As if a dam broke all at once, thoughts, concerns, anxieties and ideas that had been festering somewhere below the surface of my consciousness saw their opportunity upon my arrival in Goa and came flooding to the forefront of my mind in a volume and intensity I was unprepared for.Â Â Where am I going to live when I return to the United States?Â Â Which graduate school should I attend?Â Â Am I really ready to start my own company?Â Â Am I doomed to be single for the foreseeable future?Â Â On one hand it has been great to get a chance to just think for hours on end, but on the other I wonder if this bombardment of mostly unanswerable or premature questions is simply my mindâs reaction to screeching from the incredibly fast-paced and high-stimulation lifestyle Iâve been living to the slow serenity of life quite literally on a palm-lined paradise.Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">While none of my questions have been definitively answered and my future tan still sports the bright red of a fresh sunburn, I do think these past seven days have been very good for me as both a time of refreshment and as a time of reflection, and that they will no doubt serve me as well going forward as they have here.Â Â Tomorrow I will pack my bags and load my motorcycle once again, and even though Nick, my friend Mike who just joined us here and I still donât know exactly where weâll be going next, I do have a sense that it is time to move on, even though looking at my seventh beautiful sunset in a row over the mild ocean waves reminds me that Iâve spent this time in a very amazing place, and that someday, perhaps even tomorrow, I will find myself missing the simple life I have enjoyed here.</span></p>

font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">With a virtual wrecking ball keeping the road clear before me, I take the opportunity to let my eyes wander away from what is right in front and instead enjoy the sights all around me.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The road is bustling and beautiful.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Colors abound from every angle.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Above me branches of mature deciduous trees mingle to block the sun, letting only the occasional bright ray through and moving with a gentle breeze to make aÂ </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">kaleidoscopeÂ </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">of green and blinding gold.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Along the road to my right and left walk women dressed in bright red, pink, and yellow saris carrying on their heads gigantic stacks of branches, surely twice their height if stood upright, lashed together and perfectly balanced.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Men in off-white shirts lead large wooden ox-carts and the magnificent beasts that slowly propel them.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In a manner Iâve never seen before, their horns are completely painted from broad base to sharp tip in almost neon shades of orange and green, with each team of animalsâ horns matching perfectly.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Beyond the road and the lining trees stretches a narrow river valley winding gently toward the mountains.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Sunk at least a meter below the level of the road, small fields stand perfectly level, separated from one another with a few out of place looking trees or a berm of red clay.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Each field, roughly rectangular in shape, stands slightly higher or lower than its neighbor to conform to the gradually climbing topography.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Some fields are tilled or fallow, but most have a mix of bright green chutes and muddy water, with the density and height of the plants within them giving anything from a freckled brown to a electric green reflection in the mid-day sun.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Surprisingly I see almost nobody in the fields working them.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I guess the bright sun is all the attention they need right now.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Finally I manage to pass the huge truck and now nothing but open road is in front of me.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The condition of the asphalt varies inexplicably from new and smooth to old and potholed, but with almost no traffic now left in front of me, I can tolerate a few bumps.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Finally the lush, well-watered valley comes to an end, and the road begins to climb in earnest.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Twisting upward, corners are now made blind by thick vegetation, but this too I donât mind.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Upshifting and downshifting for the roadâs sake instead of the excess of vehicles and people crowded upon it is what makes operating this machine so much fun.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I feel the slow thrusting put put put of the engine as I miscalculate how much to downshift and try to accelerate out of a turn in too high a gear.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Even after all these miles, I still feel like an amateur on a road like this one.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The road rounds one last turn and then levels out at the top of the climb.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It didnât actually seem like that long of a climb, but no sooner can I think this than Iâm speeding through a cut in the ridge that marks the crest of the mountain pass and a panorama opens before me that I will never forget.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As if a giant ice cream scoop had pulled the very earth away from that ridge, the landscape before me drops immediately down hundreds of feet into a broad valley of arid wilderness that extends all the way to the hazy horizon.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">At the end of the first switchback I stop the bike and Nick and I stand before this magnificent view without another human being in sight.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We donât even talk much, but to me the significance of this place is unmistakable: we have made it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Out there past the haze lies that wondrous place weâve heard so much of called Goa, and also our reward.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And while we may not be quite there yet, we are now so close that it is literally downhill from here.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The ride down is slow and windy but my mood is so elevated from the last two hours of riding that I feel as if nothing can bring me down from this rare feeling of unconditional bliss.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">How am I so lucky as to be here â on this road, on this day, traveling by the manner that I am?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And while I may later try to describe it, can this feeling ever really be shared?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Even though I am traveling with Nick, I could tell from his silence and his demeanor when we stopped that his mood is quite different from mine, having been run off the road by crazy Indian traffic an hour back.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Today may become just another long slog on the road to Goa for him, but to me it is already something magical.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Feeling blissfully reflective, I think further: perhaps it is these magical moments, of which I have had several since beginning my travels nearly four months ago, though not so many I cannot remember each one individually, that really come to define a lifetime to the person who is living it.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It was quite clear to me talking to Ajit about not only his motorcycle ride into the Himalayas, but also his globe trotting as a young man in the 1970âs, that he carries around nuggets of memory that, much more than making amusing stories to two new friends, clearly have very special and personal significances to him.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">He described spending weeks in a peaceful Kashmiri houseboat as a twenty-five-year-old hippy, yet now that is only a story and a memory unable to be recreated, because peace sadly left those shores many years ago.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">What about the road I am driving on today?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">How will it change?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The one certainty I have is that it will never be just how I experienced it to anyone else.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Now at the bottom of the valley and on the coastal highway heading south, I am forced to focus more on the immediate dangers of Indian roads and less on the significance of experience and memory.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">But as the day wanes and Nick and I finally enter Goa, we again leave the main road and follow for a few miles a broad, flat, slow-moving river.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Looking across its bright reflective surface with palm trees lining both shores is the best welcome Goa could have ever given me.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The sun is low in the sky, and with our mutual course being due west, it feels like the sun, the river and I are all lazily completing the last stage of a long journey to our shared destination of the waiting sea.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And just like that, twice in one day, I get one of thoseÂ <em style="">Iâll never forget this until the day I die</em>Â sort of shivers running down my back.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I feel so privileged to be here in India, having this adventure I am on.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yet as I drive these last few miles to the wave-filled sunset I know is only minutes away, my thoughts wander once more, this time to the most unexpected place: to little baby Connor somewhere in the natal ward of a Connecticut hospital.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Yes, while I only know his name because his delivery nurse, my friend, answered with it when I asked the gender of the baby she had just delivered, I cannot help at this moment but feel a connection to him, a person I am almost certain never to meet.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For on the far side of the world the sun is also rising, and for him, it is rising on the first full day of his life.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And while it is inevitable that by the time he can ride a motorcycle or travel the world all the places I have just traversed will be quite different, as surely as the world I travel through now is different from that experienced by Ajit years ago, I hope, strongly and sincerely and with all the optimism in my being, that little baby Connor will also be so privileged as to have days like the one I just had, because these are the days that make life so great to live.</span></p>
