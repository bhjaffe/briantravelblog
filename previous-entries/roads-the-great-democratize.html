</em></span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I am four days into my two-month tour of India, and although every day has been busy to the brink of overwhelming, looking back on where I have actually spent my time, the vast majority has been spent in one very specific setting: on the road.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">To be fair, the reason for all this road time has much to do with how I will be spending my next fifty-five days here: my best friend Nick and I are touring India on Royal Enfield motorcycles, complete with metal panniers, luggage racks, and the blessings bestowed upon them in send-off ceremonies by the Sikh motorcycle shop owner in Delhi from whom weâre renting them.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">So while my parents spent their first full day in India touring the Red Fort of Old Delhi and the lavish gardens of a Mogul mausoleum, I joined Nick to ride the motorcycle he had the day before rented for me back across the crowded boulevards of Delhi to the bike shop to get a crash course in motorcycle maintenance and to finalize some paperwork.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Most people have heard at least secondhand accounts of roads in India:</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">cows, bicycles, rickshaws, cars, trucks, busses and pedestrians all somehow coexisting on these narrow planes of dirt and asphalt.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I had likewise heard several stories, so I was actually not that surprised or overwhelmed when I first took to the road on my motorcycle only fourteen hours after arriving in the country for the first time.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Somehow the chaos of it all made sense to me, although my ease of weaving through Delhi traffic was perhaps a case of suspended disbelief, because the experience was also so foreign it bordered on surreal.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">First, I must explain that more than just the conditions on the ground made me feel this way.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The smog and fog combination that has blanketed Delhi every day I have been there was unlike anything I have experienced before.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The thickness of the air made seeing anything farther than a few hundred yards impossible, and so riding through the various districts of the city felt like a series of re-emergences with no relation of the run-down, shack lined neighborhood I passed through on one side of a busy intersection to the ritzy embassy filled neighborhood I found myself driving through on the other.Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Even at midday the sun was so obscured that I could easily stare at the faint red circle with my bare eyes, and not once in all my time in the city did I see a proper shadow on the ground.Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Another factor making the entire driving and riding experience surreal was the constant need to pay attention to the bumper and break lights only feet in front of me in the free-form lane-independent style of driving here.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">So for my first two days in India the crowds of people, the roadside shrines and temples, the fruit stands, the cows, the begging children, and all the other new and unusual things to see on or next to a road just faded into a blur of generic Indian road background as I motored to and from this shop or that event around the sprawling metropolis of Delhi.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">On my third day, however, the roads of India did push me out of my comfort zone, so far so, in fact, that I nearly reached my limit of being on any road altogether.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">It was on this day that Nick, Sally (Nickâs lady friend whom he met during the three preceding months he spent volunteering in India) and I set out from Delhi to the city of Patiala in the Northern Indian state of Punjab.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This was also meant to be our shakedown trip before we set out in earnest on our great Indian motorcycling adventure because it was along purportedly high quality roads and a well-traveled route. Â We would also return to Delhi two days later for any mechanical tune-ups deemed necessary after a few days of riding.Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Our purpose in Patiala was to attend my sister and her Indian husbandâs wedding reception put on by his parents in their hometown, and thus the one requirement of our trip was to arrive as scheduled sometime that day.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">For the estimated four-hour journey (according to Google maps) Nick and I decided to play it safe and leave mid-morning, aiming for a departure of around ten thirty.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">As these sorts of things always go, we didnât actually hit the road until quarter past eleven, but it was still before noon and by all calculations we still had plenty of time to make our destination before sundown.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">That was false assumption number one.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">False assumption number two was that there would be at least some streets signs to guide us to the major highway (National Highway Number 1, youâd think thereâd be a sign!) we were to take northward from the capital.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, after being on what we thought was the correct road for nearly an hour, Nick was implored to stop by an adamant motorist from whom we thankfully, albeit frustratingly, learned that we had somehow gotten on the wrong highway and were traveling in the completely wrong direction through the industrial outskirts of Delhi.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">(The man knew we were lost because, a he put it, there was absolutely nothing touristy to see anywhere along that highway.)</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We backtracked to the correct highway but had already lost the better part of two hours in the process.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Finally on the right road, another forty-five minute delay struck less than an hour outside Delhi (this time in the form of a series of roadside cell phone calls to straighten out a logistical misunderstanding involving Nick and Sallyâs left behind luggage), and so without the feeling of having covered any significant distance my watch already read the ominous hour of four oâclock.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We hadnât even reached our planned lunch break destination and yet my thoughts were already on the now visible sun lowering in the sky.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">How late would an early January sunset be at this latitude?</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">A sinking feeling in my gut told me that the answer was sometime long before we would reach our destination.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">That was true, but just how true I did not yet appreciate.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Up until this point the highway leading north from Delhi was not too different from any six-lane interstate in the United States.Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Long, straight and flat, it was easy to travel at least eighty kilometers-per-hour among the moderate traffic of cars, trucks and auto-rickshaws.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">However, not too long after recommencing our northern journey we entered a construction zone, one that we would discover extended in some form or another for the remainder of our route along the highway.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Iâm sure some day National Highway Number 1 will be the crown jewel of the Indian highway system, but right now it alternates between lineless, shoulderless, and signless three lane wide stretches of asphalt and single lane detours built to the sides of a half completed overpasses.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And with every constriction of the roadway onto the narrow detours, a pileup of bumper-to-bumper traffic slowed our progress to a crawl.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">The sun seemed to be sinking faster and faster toward the horizon but we were going slower and slower on the road to Patiala.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We finally passed our lunch stop around sunset.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">A small bag of chips was all weâd eaten since breakfast but we kept on going, afraid to fall any further behind.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Dusk turned to night and the traffic seemed to thicken and slow even more.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">What had once been to me a jovial symphony of honking horns reminding me of how wild and adventurous an idea it was to motorcycle through India was now an infernal racket and each obnoxious honk was driving me closer and closer to madness.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Oncoming lights nearly blinded me, especially in the all too frequent case of someone straight driving their car or motorcycle the wrong way down the left shoulder with their high beams on.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">My concentration was absolute, as this undulating sea of lights and vehicles gave no option for error, but my mood was deteriorating rapidly and I could not bear the thought of how much farther we had to go.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â </span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Finally I pulled over, having been leading Nick and Sallyâs bike since before the sun went down, mentally fried and and seriously questioning whether continuing on was a wise idea.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">âThis is insane!â I yelled to Nick as he pulled up behind me.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">âIâd call it more chaotic than insane,â he said in reply, evidently not as shaken as I was.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">We stopped for a while at one of the hundreds of roadside shack/restaurants we had seen since leaving Delhi and looked at the map.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">I called my brother-in-law and told him where we were and got clarifications on the final leg of the journey to Patiala.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Like every stop we had made so far, Nick, Sally and I were instantly a spectacle to everyone around us, but unlike earlier stops where we either said a quick hello (to the nicer half of onlookers) or asked them with deteriorating levels of politeness to move along (to the gawkier half, who are especially taken with the appearance of Sally), at this stop we were simply too exhausted to be anything other than three more weary travelers on the side of the road.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Even with the sun long since set, the constant stream of humanity passing along this linear existence was unrelenting.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Trucks piled eighteen feet in the air with sticks and two men sitting on top of them, motorcycles with three or even four passengers, old bicycles with shoeless white-bearded men, women with giant loads balanced on their heads, luxury sedans with their chauffeurs honking incessantly as if that would spare their employers from the crawling traffic, three-wheeled auto-rickshaws with families of eight somehow piled inside: before me all these and more passed by, as ignorant to my presence just twenty feet off the road as I had been to theirs a moment before when all I cared about was not colliding with the next vehicle or obstacle in front of me.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">This was a national highway, but it was also a nation on a highway, and in this one setting nobody was able to escape the limitations placed on him or her by the presence of another.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">After that break I let Nick take the lead for a while, and between following another bike (which is way easier than leading the way into undefined fog-covered road and blinding oncoming lights) and a miraculous thinning of the traffic I was able to muster the energy and will to push through the final hour and a half of our journey.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">In all we spent nearly ten hours on the road between Delhi and Patiala, the last three in the dark, and upon arrival all three of us were so mentally and physically exhausted we could hardly function as normal human beings.</span></p><p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Today I went to my sister and brother-in-lawâs wedding reception, which was an absolutely gorgeous event in the gardens of a palace-turned-hotel with trees wrapped in orange marigold garlands, delicious Indian cuisine, and the finest company in the state of Punjab (to include a three-star general and his entourage of armed bodyguards).</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Before the event I had the chance to take my dad on a quick motorcycle ride around town and, with no agenda or long journey to complete, I remembered just how fun it is to be back on the roads of India.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">Even in a much smaller city than Delhi, there is still the eclectic mix of every part of society sharing these roads, each for his or her own purpose in relative harmony, and sharing in a sense upon them the same successes, frustrations, dangers, and opportunities that make up life on the road.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; ">Â Â </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia; " class="Apple-style-span">And even while I awed later in the day over pictures some other American friends had taken during their trip through India and thought to myself that I havenât visited one touristy site yet since being here, I also know that I have already seen â I have already experienced â a side of what makes India India; and to have experienced that, photo opportunities can certainly wait, at least another day or two.</span></p>
